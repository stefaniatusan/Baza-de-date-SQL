# Database Project for  Bycicle Store

The scope of this project is to use all the SQL knowledge gained throught the Software Testing course and apply them in practice.

**Application implemented:** [bycicle store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server=ver16&tabs=ssms)

**Tools used:** MySQL Workbench

**Database description:** 

The database that was created is used in order to create a store for selling bycicles. It has the purpose of creating reports related to sales and generate statistics. 


## Database Schema 

You can find below the database schema that was generated through Reverse Engineer and which contains all the tables and the relationships between them.

<img width="609" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8357bd-76e8-41f1-8f89-3f9cc96db024">

The tables are connected in the following way:


- **sales**  is connected with **salesodersdetail** through a **one to many** relationship which was implemented through **sales_productId** as a primary key and **salesOrdersDetail_Product_Id** as a foreign key

- other tables that were created: ordersDetail, delivery. These tables are to be connected through parent-child relationships with the rest of the tables in the database

## Database Queries

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

The following instructions were written in the scope of CREATING the structure of the database (CREATE INSTRUCTIONS)

```
create database MagazinBiciclete
```

```
create table sales
(
    productId int primary key, 
    product_name varchar(20),
    colour varchar(20),
    safetyStockLevel int,
    sellStartDate date,
    standardCost int,
    List_price int
    );
```

```
create table orders
(
    sales_OrderId int, 
    order_quantity int,
    productId int,
    CarrierTrackingNumber varchar (20)
    );
```

```
create table salesOrdersDetail 
(
    sales_OrderId int not null, 
    order_quantity int,
    productId int,
    CarrierTrackingNumber varchar (20),
    constraint fk_productId foreign key (productId) references sales (productId)
    );
```  

After the database and the tables have been created, a few ALTER instructions were written in order to update the structure of the database, as described below:

```
 alter table sales modify product_name varchar(40)
```
```
alter table orders rename SalesOrderDetail
```
```
alter table salesordersdetail drop primary key
```
  
### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

In order to be able to use the database I populated the tables with various data necessary in order to perform queries and manipulate the data. 
In the testing process, this necessary data is identified in the Test Design phase and created in the Test Implementation phase. 

Below you can find all the insert instructions that were created in the scope of this project:

```
insert into sales
(productId, product_name, colour, safetyStockLevel, sellStartDate, standardCost, List_price)

```

After the testing process, I deleted the data that was no longer relevant in order to preserve the database clean: 

```
delete from salesordersdetail where sales_OrderId = 46365
```


### DQL (Data Query Language)


In order to simulate various scenarios that might happen in real life I created the following queries that would cover multiple potential real-life situations:

```
select*from delivery;
```
```
select*from salesordersdetail;
```
```
select*from sales cross join salesordersdetail;
```
```
select*from sales left join salesordersdetail on sales.productId = salesordersdetail.productId;
```
```
select*from sales right join salesordersdetail on sales.productId = salesordersdetail.productId;
```
```
select*from sales;
```
```
select*from sales order by standardCost;
```
```
select*from sales order by sellStartDate desc limit 2008;
```
```
select*from salesordersdetail s left join delivery d on s.sales_orderId = d.productId where d.productId is null;
```
```
select*from salesordersdetail s left join delivery d on s.sales_orderId = d.productId where statusDelivery = "no";
```
```
desc delivery;
```

## Conclusions

Utilizarea corectă a cheilor primare și secundare: Acestea sunt esențiale pentru menținerea integrității datelor și pentru definirea relațiilor dintre tabele.
Optimizarea interogărilor: Indicii și optimizarea interogărilor sunt cruciale pentru performanța bazei de date, mai ales pe măsură ce volumul de date crește.
Documentarea și gestionarea modificărilor: Documentarea fiecărei modificări și a fiecărei structuri de date ajută la menținerea unei baze de date coerente și ușor de gestionat pe termen lung.
